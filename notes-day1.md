Introduction to JavaScript

INTRODUCTION
This is a book about instructing computers.
If the task you have for your computer is a common, well-understood one, such as showing you your email or acting like a calculator, you can open the appropriate application and get to work.
Programming is the act of constructing a program—a set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do.
Fortunately, if you can get over that fact, and maybe even enjoy the rigor of thinking in terms that dumb machines can deal with, programming can be rewarding.
Most programming is done with programming languages.
At one point language-based interfaces, such as the BASIC and DOS prompts of the 1980s and 1990s, were the main method of interacting with computers.
This book will try to make you familiar enough with this language to do useful and amusing things with it.

ON PROGRAMMING
Besides explaining JavaScript, I will introduce the basic principles of programming.
There will be times when reading this book feels terribly frustrating.
It is up to you to make the necessary effort.
A program is many things.
A computer is a physical machine that acts as a host for these immaterial machines.
A program is a building of thought.
But without care, a program’s size and complexity will grow out of control, confusing even the person who created it.
Some programmers believe that this complexity is best managed by using only a small set of well-understood techniques in their programs.
This is not only boring, it is ineffective.

WHY LANGUAGE MATTERS
In the beginning, at the birth of computing, there were no programming languages.
That is a program to add the numbers from 1 to 10 together and print out the result: 1 + 2 + ... + 10 = 55.
Of course, manually entering these arcane patterns of bits (the ones and zeros) did give the programmer a profound sense of being a mighty wizard.
The moral of this story is that the same program can be expressed in both long and short, unreadable and readable ways.
A good programming language helps the programmer by allowing them to talk about the actions that the computer has to perform on a higher level.

WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT
JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages in the Netscape Navigator browser.
It is important to note that JavaScript has almost nothing to do with the programming language named Java.
After its adoption outside of Netscape, a standard document was written to describe the way the JavaScript language should work so that the various pieces of software that claimed to support JavaScript were actually talking about the same language.
There are those who will say terrible things about JavaScript.
This flexibility also has its advantages, though.
There have been several versions of JavaScript.
The fact that the language is evolving means that browsers have to constantly keep up, and if you’re using an older browser, it may not support every feature.
Web browsers are not the only platforms on which JavaScript is used.

CODE, AND WHAT TO DO WITH IT
Code is the text that makes up programs.
I recommend you try your solutions to exercises in an actual JavaScript interpreter.
When reading this book in your browser, you can edit (and run) all example programs by clicking them.
If you want to run the programs defined in this book outside of the book’s website, some care will be required.

The Complete ECMAScript 2015-2019 Guide

ECMAScript is the standard upon which JavaScript is based, and it's often abbreviated to ES.
Beside JavaScript, other languages implement(ed) ECMAScript, including:
- ActionScript
- JScript

TC39 is the committee that evolves JavaScript.
Before ES2015, ECMAScript specifications were commonly called by their edition.
edition   Official name
ES10	    ES2019
ES9	      ES2018
ES8	      ES2017
ES7	      ES2016
ES6	      ES2015

ES.Next is a name that always indicates the next version of JavaScript.
So at the time of writing, ES2019 has been released, and ES.Next is ES2020
